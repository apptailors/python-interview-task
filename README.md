# Audio Transcription and Speaker Identification Coding Exercise

## Objective
The main objective of this exercise is to use Whisper AI to create a transcript of an audio file. As a bonus, you are encouraged to add speaker identification and build a simple frontend to display the transcript and speaker details.

## Assignment Details

1. **Transcription Task:**
   - Use Whisper AI to transcribe the provided audio file.
   - Audio file URL: [Canadian Wildfires Audio](https://github.com/AssemblyAI-Examples/audio-examples/raw/main/20230607_me_canadian_wildfires.mp3)
   - WHISPER API key: `sk-svcacct-7ToUtqZ8vI9Fccw1Ng5AT3BlbkFJdtBq3tHjgHeDn35u99Tu`

2. **Bonus I: Speaker Identification**
   - Implement speaker identification within the transcript.
   - Clearly label different speakers in the transcript.

3. **Bonus II: Frontend Development**
   - Build a simple frontend to display the transcript and speaker details.
   - You can use any technology for the frontend, including low-code solutions like Retool.

## Requirements

- **Backend Implementation:**
  - Create a Python script that:
    - Downloads the audio file.
    - Uses Whisper AI to transcribe the audio.
    - (Bonus) Identifies different speakers and marks them in the transcript.
  - Ensure the script is well-documented and includes instructions on how to run it.

- **Frontend Implementation (Bonus II):**
  - Build a simple interface to display the transcript.
  - If implementing speaker identification, display the transcript with speaker labels.
  - Ensure the frontend is user-friendly and easy to navigate.

## Deliverables

1. **Python Script:**
   - The main Python script for transcription.
   - A README file with instructions on how to set up and run the script.
   - Any additional files or modules used.

2. **Frontend Code (Bonus II):**
   - The code for the frontend application.
   - Instructions on how to set up and run the frontend (if not using a low-code solution).
   - A link to the deployed frontend (if applicable).

3. **Documentation:**
   - Clear and concise documentation explaining:
     - How to set up the environment.
     - How to run the transcription script.
     - How to access and use the frontend.
     - Any additional setup required.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Functionality:** The script correctly transcribes the audio file using Whisper AI.
- **Code Quality:** The code is clean, well-structured, and follows best practices.
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive and clear instructions provided.
- **Bonus I:** Implementation of speaker identification.
- **Bonus II:** Development and deployment of a user-friendly frontend.

## Submission
- Please provide a link to a GitHub repository containing all your code and documentation.
- Include any additional notes or comments in the repository's README file.
